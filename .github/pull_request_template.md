<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘‰ STEP 1: Welcome! Thanks for taking the time to submit a pull request!
     Even if you're a seasoned developer, this PR etiquette gist is always a
     good read: https://gist.github.com/mikepea/863f63d6e37281e329f8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘‰ STEP 2: We thoughtfully review both implementation AND feature design.
     If you are making a nontrivial change, it's recommended to first create
     a GitHub issue and get feedback on your proposed design.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘‰ STEP 3: Write a concise but specific PR title in the box above.
     Prefix your PR with its type.
     For example, if your PR fixes docs then your GitHub title might look like:

     "[docs] Add reference to cool new feature"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Summary

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘‰ STEP 4:  In a few sentences, write a summary explaining:

     From the perspective of an end user, what problem are you solving?
     What did you change?

     You can add the magic phrase "Fixes #1234" to automatically close
     issue #1234 when your PR is merged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Details

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘‰ STEP 5: Provide additional details about your fix:

     How did you solve the problem?
     Mention any alternate approaches you considered.
     Did you completely solve the problem, or are some cases not handled yet?
     Does this change break backwards compatibility?
     Could any aspects of your change impact performance?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## How it was tested

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘‰ STEP 6: What test cases did you use to validate your work?
     Given the complexities of how build tools interact with the OS, we only
     require unit tests for algorithmic code (e.g. parsing a string, sorting a list).

ðŸ‘‰ STEP 8: Do the checklist!
